Film List is an application that allows a user to create lists of films that they have seen and that they want to see. On the home page there is a search bar for films to add to the movies to see list and buttons that will take the user to either the to see or seen lists. Each list displays the titles and when clicked will take the user to a details page for each film. For films on the to see list, the title, year released, the mpaa rating, the synopisis, and the average rating from IMDB. There is also an add to seen button when clicked will pull up a page to rate and review the film and a button to add it to the seen list. For films on the seen list, the users rating and review are displayed plus the date seen.
